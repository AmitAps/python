"""
Functions are like a mini-program inside your program.

The main point of functions is to get rid of dupliate code.

The def statement defines a function.

The input to functions are arguments. The outout is the return value.

The parameters are the variables in between the function's parentheses in the def statement.

The return value is specified using the return statement.

Every function has a return value. If your function doesn't have a return statement, the return value is None.

Keyword arguments to functions are usually for optional arguments.
The print() function has keyword arguments end and sep.
