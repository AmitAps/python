#In Python, itâ€™s important that you define the function before you use it, so
#make sure the code that calls (or uses) the function comes after the definition of the function:


#This line isn't indented, because it is part of the main program.

while another == "Y":

#Every time that Python sees make_smoothie() in the code, it jumps
#to the code in the make_smoothie() function. It runs the code in the
#function until it gets to the end, and then returns to the next line in the
#code that called it.
