#Functions + Modules = The Standard Library
#Import the function from its module...
from os import getcwd
where_am_I = getcwd() #then invoke as required.

#Functions are inside modules inside the Standard library.

#A collection of related functions makes up a module, and there are lots of modules in the standard library.
