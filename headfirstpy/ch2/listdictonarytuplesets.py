#A variable takes on the type  of the value assigned.

#Everything is an object in Python, and any object can be assigned to a variable.

#Python comes with four built-in data structures that you can use to hold any collection of objects, and they are list, tuple, dictionary, and set.

#A list is like an array- the objects it stores are ordered sequentially in slots.

#List: an ordered mutable collection of objects

#A list in Python is very similar to the notion of an array in other programming languages, in that you can think of a list as being an indexed collection of related objects, with each slot in the list numbered from zero upward.
#Unlike arrays in a lot of other programming languages, though, lists are dynamic in Python, in that they can grow (and shrink) on demand.

#Tuple: an ordered immutable collection of objects

#A tuple is an immutable list. This means that once you assign objects to a tuple, the tuple cannot be changed under any circumstance.
#It is often useful to think of a tuple as a constant list.

#Tuples are like lists, except once created they CANNOT change. Tuples are constant lists.
#A tuple is an immutable list.


#Dictionary: an unordered set of key/value pairs

#Dictionaries are unordered and mutable. It can be useful to think of Pythonâ€™s dictionary as a two-columned, multirow data structure. Like lists, dictionaries can grow (and shrink) on demand.

#Dictionaries associate keys with values, and (like lists) can dynamically shrink and grow to any size.

#A Dictionary stores key/value pairs.


#Set: an unordered set of unique objects

#In Python, a set is a handy data structure for remembering a collection of related objects while ensuring none of the objects are duplicated.

#Think of a set as a collection of unordered unique items-no duplicates allowedself.

#A set does not allow duplicate objects.
