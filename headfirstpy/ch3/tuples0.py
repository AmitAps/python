#How to spot a tuple in code

#As tuples are closely related to lists, itâ€™s no surprise that they look similar (and behave in a similar way. Tuples are surrounded by parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.)

vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] #List
print(type(vowels))

vowels1 = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') #Tuple
print(type(vowels1))
