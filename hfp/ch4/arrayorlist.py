#Sometimes, you need to deal with a whole bundle of data, all at once. To do that, most languages give you the array.

#An array is a “collection variable” or data structure. It’s designed to group a whole bunch of data items together in one place and give them a name.

#An array is itself just another variable, and you can give it its own variable name:
my_array = [7, "24", "Fish", "hat stand"]
print(my_array[1])
#Python gives you array with lists

#Python coders typically use the word “arr ains more correctly refer to a list that cont or a only data of one type, like a bunch of strings a built-
#bunch of numbers. And Python comes with purpose.in technology called “array” for just that more However, as lists are very similar and much t need
#flexible, we prefer to use them, so you don' to worry about this distinction for now.


#Array can be extended . Use the append() method to add an extra element onto the end of the array.
my_array.append("Amit")
print(my_array[4])
