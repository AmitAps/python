-->Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a
condition. If the assert condition is true, nothing happens, and your
program continues to execute as normal. But if the condition evalu-
ates to false, an AssertionError exception is raised with an optional
error message.


• Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condi-
tion as an internal self-check in your program.

• Asserts should only be used to help developers identify bugs.
They’re not a mechanism for handling run-time errors.

• Asserts can be globally disabled with an interpreter setting.
