What’s a context manager? It’s a simple “protocol” (or interface) that
your object needs to follow in order to support the with statement.
Basically, all you need to do is add __enter__ and __exit__ methods
to an object if you want it to function as a context manager. Python
will call these two methods at the appropriate times in the resource
management cycle.
